# This file installs packages and declares associated capabilities
# For each defined package,
# - it transfers the package to the host
# - it runs a specific installation script
# - it declares the associated capabilities, if any
# - it does not cleans up the file. The file is in /tmp, so it should be safe
#   to keep it there to accelerate further transfers
